"Just returned from two weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Looking back I now realize that we did not have enough time given the territory we wanted to cover. Also, we did not take into consideration the size of Australia!
One smart thing we did was to switch our trip from early March to October. The weather was great!
We did stay in Pt. Douglas which is around an hour outside of Cains. The best part was having breakfast at the Pt. Douglas Aviary. We saw beautiful birds and fed kanaroos. Up close and personal.

"Hi,
I hope you have fun planning your trip to Australia. We (my family of 6) visited America in 2004 and loved it. Didn't get to Orange County though!
Australia is a huge place! I haven't been to NZ before but I grew up in Melbourne and have family in Cairns.
Some info for you.
Cairns to Melbourne - 3hr flight
Melbourne to Sydney - 1 hr flight
Cairns will be very steamy in December. You wont be able to swim in the beaches because of 'stingers' (jellyfish) so make sure your accommodation has a pool. Have a look at the Whitsunday Islands, a little south of Cairns. If you like sailing you can hire a yacht and cruise around.
Melbourne in December will be great, with potentially some hot days eg over 35 degrees Celsius. This means it could be good to include some beach time - try Mornington Peninsula. From here you can visit Phillip Island and the Fiary Penguins. Melbourne has great food and heaps of opportunities to see live music, so try and stay close to the CBD (downtown).
I tried to get accommodation in Sydney on New Year's Eve 2007 and it was extremely expensive and hard to find. Make sure you book early and be ready for hotels to increase their prices - especially if you want a view of the harbour - where the fireworks are.
Hope this helps.

IMO, do a self drive some time between mid-June and mid-September. The train is an inflated excursion and has you fixed on the tracks. A self drive will give you freedom and flexibility across the same territory.

"Well, I think the train is luxury service and depending on the class of service you could have either the double decker carriage with the glass domed observation windows upstairs and a dedicated dining area downstairs OR the single level carriage with the oversized windows and meals delivered to your seat.

The scenery is what it is either by train or by car. You stop at the end of the first day in gritty Kamloops in a 3* hotel. This allows everyone to start up again the next morning, seeing the whole route in daylight. Our national VIA Rail rolls all night, creating about 8-10 hours of the 20 hour journey to be in the dark. The RM is not a fast train, it is a sightseeing train. Freight trains take priority and there may be a fair bit of waiting in sidings until the various trains clear and the RM can continue. Some people really like the train but for the cost, you could take a 7 day cruise to Alaska and you could certainly pay for a pretty nifty holiday here with a self drive and nice hotels. The benefits to a rental car is that you can see and take photos of those same wonderful vistas but on your own schedule and route. You can go places the train tracks don't go. Nothing wrong with taking the RM, it's something that you need to know why you're deciding one way or the other. It's about priorities and what kind of holiday you would like to have. When you read some of those Trip Reports in the Top Questions (I think I linked them in post 3, the blue printing) you can see what kind of trip others have reported on. Just so you and other future visitors could get an idea of what's possible with a car.
Here are reviews of the RM to see how those who chose that trip method liked it: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154943-d1554681-Reviews-The_Rocky_Mountaineer_Train-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html",2016,MuftiVancouver,,97,Canada,3,well i think train luxury service depending class service could either double decker carriage glass domed observation windows upstairs dedicated dining area downstairs or single level carriage oversized windows meals delivered seat.the scenery either train car. you stop end first day gritty kamloops hotel. this allows everyone start next morning seeing whole route daylight. our national via rail rolls night creating hours hour journey dark. the rm fast train sightseeing train. freight trains take priority may fair bit waiting sidings various trains clear rm continue. some people really like train cost could take day cruise alaska could certainly pay pretty nifty holiday self drive nice hotels. the benefits rental car see take photos wonderful vistas schedule route. you go places train tracks dont go. nothing wrong taking rm something need know youre deciding one way other. its priorities kind holiday would like have. when read trip reports top questions i think i linked post blue printing see kind trip others reported on. just future visitors could get idea whats possible car.here reviews rm see chose trip method liked it:,0,1,1,1,

"That is not a problem. The covid passport (coronapas) is valid 14 days after the first jab and until 42 days after the first jab (probably designed this way to encourage people to remember to get their second jab).
It's not a problem that more than 42 days have passed between first and second jabs.
As a tourist, you only need to show proof that you're fully vaccinated, you don't need the actual coronapas, so just bring whatever documentation you have and it should be fine.
You can also get tested here for free and a 2 test result will also be accepted as a valid coronapas. You have to sign up at http://www.covidresults.dk which also has a link to a page with all the test sites.

If you have any suggestions I would be please to hear them. We would have three days/nights max to tour and three/days max in Helsinki which also begs the question, where can you park up in a motorhome in Helsinki?

"Some islands in the Turku Archipelago are accessible with a motorhome, but I wouldn't do a great deal of island-hopping with a large vehicle.
Both the islands and the lakelands have their attractions and their fans. You will have to read up and make your own choice.
Rastila camp site http://www.rastilacamping.fi/en/node/16 is the obvious location in Helsinki, but it's pretty far from the centre and parking in the city center will be a headache. You might do better to base yourself in a hotel in Helsinki and explore other parts of the country with a car or motorhome.
The end of August is usually cool, with a distinct feel of fall in the air. Most people limit their swimming to a quick dip after sauna by that time of the year. I have to add that chilly rain for the duration of your stay is a distinct possibility and the charms of the countryside and islands are limited when the scenery turns to mud.

in Lappland there will still be some snow in mid May - never been to Lappland in May though, but I have heard you should be able to ski in some places till mid June. In Middle.Finland and in the south you won't see any snow (unless we'll have a really weird winter).
About the animals...
you certainly will see lots of reindeer in Lappland (they go where they please - watch out for them when driving!). Encounters with moose are not that easy to arrange... but cause you will drive a lot, you might see some crossing roads - mostly early in the morning or at dusk. I do not drive a lot, and still see a moose about once in two years....
Bears: seeing them in nature is almost like winning in the lottery. Although they have increased in number in recent years and people do see them from time to time I personally know only one person who has seen one from eye to eye - and I know many hunters!

The Lake District is located (more or less) in the southeastern part of Finland, more specifically, the region around Saimaa, the largest lake of Finland. For example Savonlinna, which is famous for its annual opera festivals, is located by this lake. For more information, check this link:
http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25710
If Saimaa is too faraway from your route, you can still experience the beauty of the hundreds of lakes in Middle-Finland (the region in the middle of the widest part of Finland).F. ex. If you'll drive down to southern Finland along the E4 road you'll drive through Viitasaari which is a little town by a beautiful lake, and Jyväskylä, a modern city by a lake.. just to mention a few.

You could visit the social housings of Mümmelmannsberg, the demonstrations of the right - winged in Dresden or the dying socialist cities of Dessau or Eisenhüttenstadt - is this what you are looking for?
You could do a farm stay in a rural area, knowing that 80% of all Germans live in cities, visit a lively students' town or visit Berlin.
A comedian said: ""There are areas where always something is ongoing - and there is Brandenburg"" . The country of Brandenbrug can be picturesque though. Or do you want to visit Gelsenkirchen within the former mining area in the West?
If you want to see the real face of a region, these items would be part of it. There is not a single face - each region is different with its own problems.
How many different regions do you want to visit?
How much do you want to travel?

"tyrus,
in a nutshell: you want to visit the standard tourist hotspots - which is not bad for the start :)
However my impression was that just these items you did not want to visit.
My first question: When you land in Hamburg, why don't you stay in Hamburg for a few days at least.
To see real Germany you can buy a day ticket in Hamburg and just take the local bus to visit the city. Get up at 5am and visit the fish market and have a breakfast roll with fish.
Locals would travel to Bad St. Peter Ording for local recreation over the weekend or to the Holsteinische Schweiz or to the heather of Lüneburg...
For museums in Berlin you will find more than enough advise in the forum - nothing more to say about.
As you want to stay 3 weeks, my recommendation would be to pick 3 to 4 different spots (maybe related to a certain topic, like small city, landscape, recreation, beaches, mountaineering, industry etc.).
Then you should try not to use the car but public transport systems. It is partly more unconvenient, however you will easier get into contact with the ""real life"". Try at least sometimes to get your lunch from a local supermarket or even the market in the city centre.
Night life can be different as well, depending on your age and interests. Some like pubs, others are into opera... the question again is, how do you nail down ""real"" Germany - is it about history, current life, musics, gay culture etc

Yes, there are demonstrations, but with a few exceptions these continue to be limited to outside specific government buildings and are largely peaceful (noisy, yes, but non-violent).

The real thanks goes to the Icelandic people for having the fortitude and stamina to force political change, because of the absolutely tragic financial events that have happened there, and the resultant effect upon Icelandic society. Everyone there has been affected.
I travel to Iceland quite a bit, so I have been trying to keep up with this as best as I can, which is a challenge as I don't speak or read Icelandic.
Most English language news about Iceland (the little there is) concerns itself with the cold, impersonal financial aspects of the financial crisis there, or the affordability of travel to Iceland now because of that crisis. Yet when stories with headlines of, ""Riots in Reykjavik"", or, ""Iceland's government collapses.."", people wonder what is going on.
As an outsider looking in, I see a very severe financial crisis that has a lot of blame to go around; but also a government that did very little to prevent it, would not take responsibility once it happened, and would not respond to Icelanders demand for accountability and change.
It is necessary to understand the magnitutide of what has happened there. Most people loss all their financial assets when the banks were nationalized. Imagine if you had a substantial portion of your life savings in a bank, and within the span of a few days, it was all gone. Zero, nothing, nada, just gone. Now imagine your home mortgage being in a different currency, and your payment is now triple what it was just 6 months ago. Now imagine most everyone you know loosing their job, or worried that they will. Unemployment has gone from 1% to 7% and will go higher. If normal unemployment here is, say, 4%, that would be the equivalent of a sudden increase in unemployment to 28%.
Very, very serious economic problems, and the government was not dealing with it. So Icelanders took matters into hand, and finally forced a political change. New political leadership will address the extremely difficult problems Iceland faces.
This is far from the travel aspects of this forum, but I think it important for those English language travelers who only see the brief news clips to understand the situation. Of course, this is just my opinion, but I think it needs to be said.
Iceland is the safest of places. The Icelandic people are the best in the world. They have accomplished so much. Iceland has financial problems that have impacted every resident there, and with their new government, they will work it thru.
Iceland is a nation of survivors, and will survive this and prosper.
If you have ever considered a visit, this is the time to go, as everything is a bargain. If you have a trip planned, don't let the headlines stop you. Once you understand the situation, the uncertainty caused by the headlines melts away.",2009,drr49,"Seattle, Washington",156,Iceland,14,hi darwinmthe real thanks goes icelandic people fortitude stamina force political change absolutely tragic financial events happened resultant effect upon icelandic society. everyone affected.i travel iceland quite bit i trying keep best i challenge i dont speak read icelandic.most english language news iceland little concerns cold impersonal financial aspects financial crisis affordability travel iceland crisis. yet stories headlines riots reykjavik icelands government collapses.. people wonder going on.as outsider looking i see severe financial crisis lot blame go around also government little prevent would take responsibility happened would respond icelanders demand accountability change.it necessary understand magnitutide happened there. most people loss financial assets banks nationalized. imagine substantial portion life savings bank within span days gone. zero nothing nada gone. now imagine home mortgage different currency payment triple months ago. now imagine everyone know loosing job worried will. unemployment gone go higher. if normal unemployment say would equivalent sudden increase unemployment .very serious economic problems government dealing it. so icelanders took matters hand finally forced political change. new political leadership address extremely difficult problems iceland faces.this far travel aspects forum i think important english language travelers see brief news clips understand situation. of course opinion i think needs said.iceland safest places. the icelandic people best world. they accomplished much. iceland financial problems impacted every resident new government work thru.iceland nation survivors survive prosper.if ever considered visit time go everything bargain. if trip planned dont let headlines stop you. once understand situation uncertainty caused headlines melts away.,0,1,2,#N/A,

"Reading lots on this forum about how hotels/flights are reasonable but anything imported is really expensive.
The truth is that it is going to get more expensive. According to the Chicago Tribune, inflation is 17% and climbing.

"Well, maybe others are able to understand better, but i have difficulties, although know about ""how to spend holidays in Lithuania"".
11 days is OK. You'll be visiting Vilnius and Kaunas, thats OK. To rent a car if you want to travel more is OK, and if ""culture, small vilages and countryside"" is OK for you, then to have a car is exellent.
Now, people can spend 11 days in both Vilnius and Kaunas and be totally busy, and similary is possible to spend 11 days outside Vilnius and Kaunas (not even visiting them) and have an incredible holiday and be totally busy. Vilnius and Kaunas are not countryside. Tallinn and Riga are not countryside either. From your question i can't understand whether you want to learn where else to go from Vilnius and from Kaunas specifically, or in between Vilnius and Kaunas specifically, or anywhere in Lithuania, because everything you have read so far tells that there is nothing around Vilnius and Kaunas, but you suspect that there must be at least ""something"", or do you expect to receive the confirmation that the territory is blank and there are no ""other"" places as such, except Vilnius and Kaunas, so naturally you will focus on Riga and Tallinn.
And when, btw, you're planning your trip, now or in summer or when? Suggestions are different for different seasons. And about that ""countryside"" you're asking, i am really speachless - ""culture"", ""small villages"", ""countryside"" are too general definitions to give suggestions because you only indicate that you're interested in ""best"" of them, but don't indicate what is best for you. Well, territory is not blank, for the starter. All that blank territory is small villages surrounded with the ""countryside"" which vary in sense of enviroment, and all territory is not integral: basically there are 5 regions that differs enviromentally and culturally, and 1 of them differs from other 4 significantly. So which one is best for you and why, how to tell you the right direction if it's not clear what is that ""best"" :) . Maybe it is availability of certain restaurants with the certain meals? Or certain level of service? Or availability of the wild and untouched nature? Or availability of nice, civilized parks and gardens of a certain style?
Riga and Tallinn deserves another 11 days, and if you include the best of Latvian countryside and the best of Estonian countryside then Tallinn and Riga deserve no less than 11 days each.

Yes, i see now what you mean.
Generally, those 3 capitals are mentioned because of simplicity - one town (tick mark, photo), another town (tick mark, photo), third town (tick mark, photo) - done. Many people are travelling this way.
Summer, as a season, should be OK, especially between the second half of June until the last week of August. Other time is not exactly summer.
I'd suggest to focus on National Parks as a ""general target"", there are 5 NPs and actually with the car you can visit more than 1 and more than 3 national parks, but to visit all it would be inconvenient because of their locations. There will be villages, there will be lakes, hillforts, forests and meadows. So you focus on ""national parks"" and as a result you have areas where all those objects of interest you've mentioned are concentrated. At the same time you can be sure that this is the ""best"", i.e. it will not be ""worst"" because those parks were established for local needs and not in order to lure tourists from abroad. Plus, while driving the car you'll see some othere places in between.
First, here is a map (scheme) of National Parks (light brown), Regional Parks (yellow) and forests (light blue-greenish) - http://www.parkai.lt/img/editor/parkai.jpg . Comparing it with the normal map you can work out your route by car. Simply, make some reasonably shaped route which includes all conveniently situated parks and you'll automatically have your personal selection of ""targets"".
Here you can find the list of Lith NPs and Regional Parks (some sort of ""budgetary national parks"") - http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lietuvos_valstybiniai_parkai .
English version is different, so i give LT version - each park is a link so you can get directly to the description of each one which has its EN version as well. There are some pictures. So you'll have some general impression, and the main job will be to work out your route by car. Regional parks may have not EN versions, you can better judge by some pictures in LT versions.
So this is regarding ""what to visit"" and ""how to select objects of interests"".
After you have some idea about the route you can always ask here any specific questions, maybe it will me reasonable to skip something what you thought may be interesting, but what in reality is not so interesting, or maybe it will be reasonable to include something else - you better work out your route according to what you think and it will be OK. We always can improve any itinerary if necessary :) . And if it's perfect then it's even better :D .
Any national park has some options of accommodation, typically not hotels (at least in LT they are not called hotels) but homesteads and rest-houses. Some ideas if necessary can be found here - http://www.atostogoskaime.lt/ (it has an EN version).",2013,tadasmm,LT,No Rating,Lithuania,21,youre rude quite clear.yes see mean.generally capitals mentioned simplicity one town tick mark photo another town tick mark photo third town tick mark photo done. many people travelling way.summer season ok especially second half june last week august. other time exactly summer.id suggest focus national parks general target nps actually car visit national parks visit would inconvenient locations. there villages lakes hillforts forests meadows. so focus national parks result areas objects interest youve mentioned concentrated. at time sure best i.e. worst parks established local needs order lure tourists abroad. plus driving car youll see othere places between.first map scheme national parks light brown regional parks yellow forests light bluegreenish . comparing normal map work route car. simply make reasonably shaped route includes conveniently situated parks youll automatically personal selection targets.here find list lith nps regional parks sort budgetary national parks .english version different give lt version park link get directly description one en version well. there pictures. so youll general impression main job work route car. regional parks may en versions better judge pictures lt versions.so regarding visit select objects interests.after idea route always ask specific questions maybe reasonable skip something thought may interesting reality interesting maybe reasonable include something else better work route according think ok. we always improve itinerary necessary : . and perfect even better :d .any national park options accommodation typically hotels least lt called hotels homesteads resthouses. some ideas necessary found en version.,0,1,1,1,

"If you are American (or even if you aren't) one of the most worthwhile things to see in my opinion is the WWII American Cemetery where General Patton is buried. After seeing this I also think it's very important to also visit the German cemetery (only about a km away and clearly marked) the contrast is stark and most people find going to both very meaningful.
Downtown Luxembourg city is beautiful - small and easy to walk around. Park the car in one of the central parking lots, stop in the tourist office on the Place Guillaume(also known as ""Knuedler"") for maps and info. They do a great walking tour if you have time. If it's a nice day, have a glass of wine or cup of coffee on the Place d'Arms just next to the Knuedler and watch the world (or at least a small slice of it) go by. You should also plan to visit the Casemates - part of the oldest part of Luxembourg's ancient fortifications. There's plenty to keep you entertained for a day.

I have spent many weeks in Bali & Thailand (big fan also), as well as Mexico & Hawaii and given your love for the former two places, I would consider sticking with Hawaii, perhaps Maui or Kauai. Mexico is very nice, but lacks a certain cultural depth and the jaw dropping beauty that I have found in the other places.
Mexico is definitely cheaper and there are many places that still have charm, despite the Gringo influx, but it's certainly a departure from SE Asia or Hawaii.
I don't think you should be concerned about safety, unless you plan to spend a significant time outside the tourism areas - or if you are involved with the Mexican Mafia :-).
Of course, this advice is all based on very little info about what makes a trip inspirational to you, so I could be completely wrong.

"If you like to go to the mountains, you definitely should go to Zakopane ( or the nearby villages). The best (warmest) month is July, but you might have some rainy days ( thats why I suggest at least 3 nights in the mountains ( for me- the longer, the better, but I love mountains and hiking).
You could , for example, spend 3 nights in Warsaw and 3 in Krakow and 3 in Zakopane. ( I usually stay in Murzasichle and take shuttles to trailheads, but for a shorter stay it is better to stay in the centre of things, that is - Zakopane.

"'My husband is interested in the capital bug''
Well unlike other capital cities in Europe, Ljubljana is small and extremely walkable. It also does not get that many tourists. So it does not have that overwhelming feeling like London or Paris would. So I feel it could suit you because you are active and like to do your own thing so you can explore the city entirely on foot. Ljubljana is also very well connected with the rest of the Slovenia, with highways leading in every direction to enable you to easily get to your next destination so I think you should at least spend one day there. It's also somewhere you could consider if you get a day of bad weather which would not be suitable for hiking because June does not guarantee perfect weather. Slovenia gets quite a lot of rainfall all year around so you can never be too sure with the weather when planning a trip entirely on outdoor activities. Sometimes it helps to find that balance. After 7 days of outdoor activities your husband and your children might appreciate the change of pace of a day exploring the city.
Finally, Bled gets more tourists than Ljubljana and the caves get a load of tourists as well. So your wish to get off the beaten path and avoid the major tourist areas as a justification for not visiting Ljubljana when you will visit Bled which is much more touristy is a bit ironic.",2020,Noyk0,,No Rating,Slovenia,30,my husband interested capital bugwell unlike capital cities europe ljubljana small extremely walkable. it also get many tourists. so overwhelming feeling like london paris would. so i feel could suit active like thing explore city entirely foot. ljubljana also well connected rest slovenia highways leading every direction enable easily get next destination i think least spend one day there. its also somewhere could consider get day bad weather would suitable hiking june guarantee perfect weather. slovenia gets quite lot rainfall year around never sure weather planning trip entirely outdoor activities. sometimes helps find balance. after days outdoor activities husband children might appreciate change pace day exploring city.finally bled gets tourists ljubljana caves get load tourists well. so wish get beaten path avoid major tourist areas justification visiting ljubljana visit bled much touristy bit ironic.,0,1,1,1,

"""Try to see the whole of Switzerland"" in September.
Switzerland is small, but plenty to see and experience, impossible to ""see the whole country"" in even much more than a month.
Best probably to use some travel guide (better printed than online), define the places you want to see and experience. And come back with more specific questions.
For getting some information online, check ""Top questions about Switzerland"" at this TripAdvisor forum webpage upper right side, and Swiss Tourist Office website http://www.myswitzerland.com but there are plenty other websites on visiting Switzerland.
Same for books, my preferred is Michelin Green Guide Switzerland.

"I have spent the last 60 or so years of my life trying to see all of Switzerland and I am nowhere near my goal. How long can you actually stay? A week? 2 weeks? A month? It makes a difference because things we might suggest here if you have a week will be very different if you have a month. Do you know for example that we have 4 linguistic and cultural areas here? 4 national languages (and no - English is not one of them). And while our country might look small to someone from the US it does have a difficult topography because we have these things called Alps. (!). Which makes getting from A to B not quite as simple as it might seem on a map.
To start with take a look at http://www.myswitzerland.com which is the excellent website of our national tourist office. They suggest some itineraries based on time allowed. If you only have a week, stick with no more than two bases and make one a town and the other somewhere in the mountains. With a month you could have four bases in the four different linguistic areas and then really learn something about Switzerland.
We have the world's best public transport system here and it is fully meshed and will get you anywhere you care to go. Trains connect within a few minutes (under 5 as a rule) and also connect with buses and sometimes lake boats. For most people coming from the US it is quite simply a revelation! so plan on public transport. Get yourself a Half Fare card and combine that with Saver Day Passes for longer travel days. See http://www.sbb.ch/en for details. Also - take the time to read the articles listed on the top right hand tool bar on this page under ""Top Questions about Switzerland"". You will save a lot of time (and probably money) by doing that.

"Hi Fellow Travellers :)
My husband and I would be visiting Switzerland for 5 days towards the end of september. We'd be travelling from Munich to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Paris.
We want to explore the countryside in Switzerland. Stay in a challet. Visit a local watering hole in the evening. Go for a small hike. And see Mt. Titlis.
Pl suggest where shall we base ourselves, Lucerne or Interlaken or some small village. Not to keen on a village as we'd be using public transport and not sure about the frequency of buses to smaller locations in Switzerland.
Also, pl suggest if we shall take a Train Pass? If yes, just a Swiss Pass or a Multi country pass for Germany, Switzerland and France. In Germany we are only visiting Munich and France only Paris.
Desperately looking forward to your suggestions :)

"End of September - kind of short time for preparing trip details, might not be ideal.
For general information on train travel in Europe see http://www.seat61.com - especially https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Munich.htm#Munich-Zurich and https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Switzerland.htm#Switzerland-Paris
You will hardly find a ""chalet"" to rent in cities here. If you mainly plan to see Titlis, do some hiking then stay in Lucerne area, and if you stay in Lucerne area consider Tell Pass rather than Swiss Travel Pass. Tell Pass covers Titlis and Pilatus, whereas holders of a Swiss Travel Pass get only a 50% discount. Interlaken is at the edge of Tell Pass validity area (just hardly worth a longer detour). But do the maths once you have defined your travel plan in Switzerland.
For most of your questions and many other see TA forum ""Top questions about Switzerland"" at this page upper right.
